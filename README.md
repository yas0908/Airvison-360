# Airvison-360
This project is a complete end-to-end AIRVISION 360: Real-time Urban Air Quality Monitoring and Guidance System designed to analyze real-time air quality, predict PM2.5 pollution levels, and visually communicate environmental risks across global cities. The system integrates multiple technologies—Machine Learning, Azure Cloud, Flask, Folium Maps, and Power BI—to deliver a highly accurate and interactive environmental intelligence platform.

The workflow begins with collecting live and historical environmental datasets, including temperature, humidity, CO, and PM2.5 levels. Live data is fetched using APIs such as OpenWeatherMap, while historical data is retrieved from Azure Blob Storage. After merging and cleaning the datasets, advanced feature engineering is applied, including time-based attributes and interaction features that significantly improve prediction accuracy.

For the machine learning component, the system uses an optimized Stacked Regressor model combining XGBoost and LightGBM, achieving strong predictive performance. The model is trained, evaluated, and deployed using Azure Machine Learning, ensuring scalability and real-time accessibility. The trained model is then integrated into a Flask-based web application, where users can view live predictions for different cities.

To enhance visualization, the project uses Folium to create an interactive global map with color-coded pollution indicators—green (safe), orange (moderate), and red (highly polluted). Users can click on any city marker to view detailed environmental data and personalized safety recommendations based on pollution severity. Additionally, the system includes a Power BI analytics dashboard for deeper insights, enabling city-wise comparisons, trend analysis, and historical vs. real-time pollution evaluation.

Overall, this project showcases a full-stack data science implementation—from data acquisition and ML modeling to cloud deployment and interactive visualization. It demonstrates how predictive analytics and modern cloud technologies can support smarter environmental monitoring, early risk detection, and improved public safety.
